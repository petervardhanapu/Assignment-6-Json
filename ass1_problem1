1. Create a JSON file (employee.json) containing employee information of minimum 5 employees.
Each employee information consists of Name, DOB, Height, City, State. 
Write a python program that reads this information from the 
JSON file and saves the information into a list of objects of Employee class. Finally print the list of the Employee objects.

import json

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, dob, height, city, state):
        self.name = name
        self.dob = dob
        self.height = height
        self.city = city
        self.state = state

with open('employee.json') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

employee_list = []

for employee_data in data:
    name = employee_data['name']
    dob = employee_data['DOB']
    height = employee_data['Height']
    city = employee_data['City']
    state = employee_data['State']

    employee = Employee(name, dob, height, city, state)
    employee_list.append(employee)

for employee in employee_list:
    print("Name:", employee.name)
    print("DOB:", employee.dob)
    print("Height:", employee.height)
    print("City:", employee.city)
    print("State:", employee.state)
    print()
